## Project proposal guidelines

### Introduction to the Problem Domain
    Start by introducing the broader problem area, and describing the challenges and motivations behind it. Explain why this area is important and what specific problem or opportunity you are addressing. Be sure to provide sufficient context to highlight the relevance of the problem.


### Description of Your Project
    Provide a clear description of your project, detailing what it is about, what objectives you aim to achieve, and how you plan to approach the problem. Elaborate on the methods or techniques you propose to use, and explain how your project contributes to addressing the identified challenges.

### Measuring Success
    Discuss the criteria or metrics you will use to evaluate the success of your project. How will you know if your objectives have been met? This section is crucial and should demonstrate a well-thought-out plan for validation, including any experiments, simulations, or performance evaluations you plan to conduct.



    
Additionally, it is important to choose a __strategic and eye-catching name for your project__. A well-chosen title can serve as a foundation for branding, __capturing the essence of your work while making it memorable and appealing__.

Consider a __concise yet descriptive name that reflects the innovation and main goal or challenge of your project__, as if it were a product or service.

While this might seem straightforward, crafting a strong proposal requires considerable research. You need to __thoroughly explore the problem domain__ by __reviewing high-quality papers, watching the latest research presentations (e.g., on YouTube) from leading institutions, and examining relevant patents__ (e.g., on Google Patents).
