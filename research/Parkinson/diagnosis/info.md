<summary>Diagnosis
 </summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[parkinson.org](https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/getting-diagnosed)

>__Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a “clinical” diagnosis__. This means that an individual’s history, symptoms, and physical exam are used to make the diagnosis. __There is not a specific lab or imaging test that can diagnose PD.__ However, certain tests such as magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (MRI brain), a dopamine transporter scan (DaT scan), or blood work can be used to support the diagnosis of PD or to rule out other medical conditions that can mimic PD.

>Making an accurate diagnosis of Parkinson’s, particularly in its early stages, can be difficult. __Often, an internist or family physician is the first to make a diagnosis__. Many people may seek an additional opinion from a movement disorder specialist. A movement disorder specialist is a neurologist with experience and specific training in the assessment and treatment of PD and related disorders.

>The newest criteria for diagnosing Parkinson’s was developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS), and reflect the most current understanding of PD.

>To consider a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, a person must have __bradykinesia__ (slowness of movement). In addition to __bradykinesia__, a person must also have __one or more__ of the following:

- __Shaking or tremor in a limb that occurs while it is at rest__
- __Stiffness or rigidity of the arms, legs, or trunk__
- __Trouble with balance and falls__

<summary>Bradykinesia
 </summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Bradykinesia](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Bradykinesia)

>Bradykinesia is a ___term used to describe slowness of movement___. It can be defined as the slowness of movement with a decrease in amplitude and speed as movement continues. [1][2]

>It usually manifest as ___difficulty initiating movement___ , ___reduced movement___ and can impact an individual's ability to carry out activities of daily living. Bradykinesia is a ___classic symptom of Parkinson's disease___, parkinsonism and ___can also be a side effect of some medications___. 

### Clinical Presentation

- [Hypomimia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomimia) - loss of or limited facial expressions

- [Hypophonia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-HfkQK4dnY&t=222s) - soft speech
- Difficulty with fine motor activities

### Bradykinesia Assessment

___Rapid alternating movements in the upper and lower extremity can be used to establish the diagnosis of bradykinesia in a patient___. During these movements, the examiner looks out for a decline in the rate and/or amplitude of movement.[5]

Bradykinesia can be assessed with the following test:

- Finger Tapping
- Fist open/close
- Pronation/supination of the hand
- Toe tapping
- Heel tapping

<summary>Tremor</summary>

[parkinsons.org](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/tremor)

>A tremor caused by Parkinson’s can appear in 2 ways:

>A ___resting tremor___. This might happen when your ___body is still and relaxed___, for example when you’re lying in bed. The most typical tremor in Parkinson’s is called a ___‘pill-rolling’ rest tremor___, as it looks like you are trying to roll a pill between your thumb and index finger.

>An ___action tremor___. This can happen when you’re doing something, like ___trying to hold a magazine or drink from a cup___.

[Additional info Tremor in Parkinson](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/what-is-parkinsons/symptoms/tremor/)



>### Finger Twitching
>The ___“pill rolling” tremor___ that is often described in medical texts refers to the tremors of the fingers, usually the thumb plus the other fingers, that makes it look as if the person is rolling a pill in the fingers. This is most often the part of the body where tremors will begin.

>### Jaw Tremors
>Jaw tremor is common in Parkinson’s, whereas head tremor is not. The ___jaw tremor looks very much like shivering, although usually slower___. ___It goes away with movement, so it is not present while chewing___. It is extremely irritating  when it is severe enough to cause the teeth to click together. For people with dentures, it may keep the dentures from staying in place, in addition to attracting attention because of the clicking sounds. Chewing gum stops the tremor.

>### Foot Tremors
>Many, if not most people, may have a leg tremor if they rest their leg in particular positions with the heel on the ground. This is not a Parkinson’s disease tremor. A foot tremor due to Parkinson’s isa resting tremor, so it is most evident when the feet are dangling or when the person is lying down. It always disappears when the person is standing, and does not interfere with walking. The tremor usually involves the feet, but the thighs may also be involved so that the whole leg moves.

>### Tongue Tremor
>Sometimes the tongue has a tremor, and in about 1% of Parkinson’s disease cases the head shakes. Sometimes the head tremors because the arms are shaking and the tremor is simply transmitted. The voice, while frequently involved in Parkinson’s, is never involved by tremor.
