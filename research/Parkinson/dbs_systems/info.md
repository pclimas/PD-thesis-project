>The DBS system consists of __three components__: an ___implanted pulse generator (IPG)___, its ___leads___ and an ___extension___. The IPG is a battery-powered neurostimulator encased in a titanium housing, which sends electrical pulses to the brain that interfere with neural activity at the target site.

>The leads are two coiled wires insulated in polyurethane with four platinum-iridium electrodes that allow delivery of electric charge from the __battery back implanted in the chest wall__. The battery pack is usually situated ___subcutaneously___ below the clavicle and rarely in the abdomen. The ___leads___, in turn, are ___connected to the battery___ by an insulated extension wire which ___travels from the chest wall superiorly along the back of the neck below the skin, behind the ear, and finally enters the skull through a surgically made burr hole to terminate in the deep nuclei of the brain___. After surgery, battery dosage is titrated to individual symptoms, a process which requires repeat visits to a clinician for readjustment.

>DBS leads are placed in the brain according to the type of symptoms to be addressed.
    
- DBS of the GPi has been shown to reduce uncontrollable movements called dyskinesias. This may sometimes allow a patient to take adequate (additional) quantities of medications (especially levodopa), thus leading to better control of symptoms.
- DBS of the subthalamic nucleus has a more sudden effect on tremor (while effect on tremor in GPi is sometimes delayed). Also, studies associated STN-DBS with reductions in dopaminergic medication.
- DBS of the VIM is more commonly done with tremor-dominant variants of PD (and essential tremor).
- Some studies suggested efficacy for DBS of the PPN in reducing freezing of gait, but results have been mixed and the target is not routinely used.

>Four male Parkinson’s patients were recruited from a population who still had ongoing motor problems despite having optimized constant DBS. Each patient identified their most bothersome motor symptom and was then randomly assigned to receive either adaptive DBS or constant DBS, and then switched. None of the participants knew which type of DBS they received.

>All four patients showed a reduction in the percentage of time of the most bothersome symptom during adaptive DBS than optimized constant DBS without worsening other symptoms. Moreover, adaptive DBD enhanced their’ quality of life, as indicated by the EQ-5D questionnaire.

>Adaptive DBS didn’t adversely affect any other motor or nonmotor symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, apathy, impulsivity, or sleep.
