#### Deep brain stimulation
>BrainSense™ technology

>The Percept™ family of neurostimulators deliver personalized, upgradable therapy, powered by BrainSense™ technology. BrainSense™ technology† uses brain signals to provide a window into a patient's condition, in real time, over time.

BrainSense™ tool: Survey

>Provides decision-making support to select therapeutic contact(s) or directionally shift stimulation during a monopolar review or follow-up programming sessions

BrainSense™ tool: Streaming

>Guides stimulation for LFP power reduction and can assist in finding stimulation-related therapeutic windows.
    Stimulation parameters can be adjusted to address potentially suboptimal therapy configurations using objective patient neurophysiologic data.

BrainSense™ tool: Thresholds

>Clinician-defined LFP thresholds may allow for rapid assessment of the time spent with or without symptoms outside of clinic.

BrainSense™ tool: Timeline

>Objective and personalized information from outside the clinic.
    Observe effects of medications and stimulation changes on LFP power.

BrainSense™ tool: Events

>A patient’s day-to-day in digital form.
    Assess and understand the frequency and magnitude of the signal of interest of events over time.
